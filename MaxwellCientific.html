        <h3>Run the Messier Marathon</h3>
        <p>
          <img src="./mediacauHW3/m20.jpg" alt="" />
          It's time for the annual
          <span class="boldtxt"> Messier Marathon</span>. Instead of lacing up
          their Nikes, amateur astronomers will be hauling telescopes, star
          charts, and a hefty pot of coffee in an all-night vigil hunting the
          Messier objects.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="boldtxt">Messier objects</span> are stellar objects,
          classified by astronomer
          <span class="boldtxt">Charles Messier </span> in the 18th century,
          ranging from distant galaxies to star clusters to stellar nebula. Now
          is the only time of the year in which all 110 Messier objects are in
          the sky. Unfortunately, if you want to see all of them, you have to
          start looking right after sunset and continue until just before
          sunrise — hence the term, "marathon>."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ironically, Charles Messier wasn't all that interested in his objects.
          He made the list in order to avoid seeing them. Messier was more
          interested in discovering new comets and these beautiful stellar
          objects kept getting in the way.
